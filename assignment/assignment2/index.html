    # Week 4 - Assignment 2

    ## Introduction

    Grids are at the foundation of many web designs (http://designmodo.com/grid-design-theory/).
    For this assignment, you will try to recreate a design from a real website.

    ## Using a Grid

    The CSS file css/grid.css contains several classes that set up the grid we
    will use for this exercise. Take a look at it to see what classes it offers.

    1. column: a column controls the width of a block of content in the grid
    2. row: a row is used to create a horizontal group of columns
    3. container: a container positions a row in the center of the page and gives
       it the proper width

    Example:

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column-one-third">
          Fruits that are good
        </div>
        <div class="column-two-thirds">
          <ul>
            <li>Pears</li>
            <li>Plums</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    ## Task

    Recreate one of the following websites using your own code. For each website,
    see the screen capture that shows which parts to recreate. Your goal for
    recreating these sites is to make them look as similar as possible in terms
    of style and layout. However, you should use your own text and images. For
    royalty free images, check out http://thestocks.im/ or use your own photos.

    ## Do your best!

    Don't worry about getting it perfect. Just try to get it as close as you can.

          <p> Brody is a 2.5 year old Golden Retriever/Irish Setter mix.  His first family gave him up becase they couldn't handle the energy of a Golden Retriever puppy.  They took him to Delaware Valley Golden Retriever Rescue.  He was there for a few months before he was adopted by his forever family when he was a year old.  He is a very sweet and happy boy who loves to snuggle.</p>
